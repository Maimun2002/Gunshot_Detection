# Gunshot_Detection

The project is a critical application in the areas of public safety, surveillance and law enforcement. It focuses on building a machine learning based system to accurately classify gunshot sounds from other audio signals and identify the angle and approximate location of the source of fire. It makes use of notable ML algorithms to filter environmental noises and complex mathematical calculations to achieve the accurate angles and distance of the position the bullet is fired.
